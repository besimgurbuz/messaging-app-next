## Installation And First Run

### With Docker

Clone this(back-end) repository

```
git clone https://github.com/besimgurbuz/messaging-app-next.git
```

After cloning you should change `.env.sample` file name to `.env` file and paste correct secrets which I send you:

```
cd messaging-app-next
mv .env.sample .env
```

Now you are ready to clone front-end. Don't forget both of these repos should be in the same directory. So:

```
cd ..
```

Clone front-end [repository](https://github.com/besimgurbuz/messaging-app-ui)

```
git clone https://github.com/besimgurbuz/messaging-app-ui.git
```

### âš  Important âš 

You should clone both of these repositories into the same directory.

#### Running

There are same `docker-compose.yml` files both of these repos. You can use any of these `docker-compose.yml` file for running. But first you should move `docker-compose.yml` file into the upper directory which includes both repositories.
```
$ mv ./messaging-app-next/docker-compose.yml ./docker-compose.yml
```

##### You should see this output when you command `ls`

```
$ ls
  messaging-app-next
  messaging-app-ui
  docker-compose.yml
```

In this directory run:

```
docker-compose up
```

After docker-compose install and run our both back-end and front-end now you can open [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

Another **important note** I recommend you to open app in Chrome or close any cookie & local storage browser blocker.

### Without Docker

```
git clone https://github.com/besimgurbuz/messaging-app-next.git
```

Create `.env` file. And paste secrets which I send.

```
$ cd messaging-app-next
$ mv .env.sample .env
```

#### Installing dependecies and running.

```
# You should be in the messaging-app-next folder
$ pwd
  $YOUR_CLONE_DIRECTORY/messaging-app-next

# Installing dependencies
$ npm install

# Running
$ npm run start

# With nodemon
$ npm run dev
```

Now open another terminal and clone front-end [repository](https://github.com/besimgurbuz/messaging-app-ui).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/besimgurbuz/messaging-app-ui.git
```

#### Installing dependencies and running.

```
$ cd messaging-app-ui

$ npm install

$ npm run start

```

Now you are ready to open [app](http://localhost:4200). Horay!!
